# Campaign Data Lookup

Guides efficient lookup and navigation of campaign data within the 5e-cursor project.

## Campaign Structure

Campaign data is stored in `campaign/` with the following structure:

```
campaign/
├── campaign.md          # Campaign overview and metadata
├── party/
│   ├── index.md         # Party roster with average level, size
│   └── characters/      # Imported character sheets (*.md)
├── npcs/
│   ├── index.md         # NPCs organized by role (ally/neutral/enemy)
│   └── *.md             # Individual NPC files
├── locations/
│   ├── index.md         # Location index
│   └── *.md             # Individual location files
├── sessions/
│   ├── index.md         # Chronological session log
│   └── session-*.md     # Session summaries (session-001.md, etc.)
└── encounters/
    ├── index.md         # Saved encounter index
    └── *.md             # Individual encounter files
```

## Finding Campaign Data

### Party Information
- **Party roster**: `campaign/party/index.md`
- **Character sheets**: `campaign/party/characters/*.md`
- **Character by name**: Use filename (slugified name, e.g., `meilin-starwell.md`)

### NPCs
- **NPC index by role**: `campaign/npcs/index.md`
- **Individual NPCs**: `campaign/npcs/*.md`
- **Find NPC**: Search by name in index or use slugified filename

### Locations
- **Location index**: `campaign/locations/index.md`
- **Individual locations**: `campaign/locations/*.md`

### Sessions
- **Session log**: `campaign/sessions/index.md`
- **Specific session**: `campaign/sessions/session-NNN.md` (zero-padded)
- **Latest session**: Sort by number, highest is most recent

### Encounters
- **Saved encounters**: `campaign/encounters/index.md`
- **Individual encounters**: `campaign/encounters/*.md`

## Cross-References

Campaign files link to reference data using relative paths:

- From `campaign/party/characters/*.md` → `../../../books/reference/...`
- From `campaign/encounters/*.md` → `../../books/reference/...`

Reference links format: `[Name](relative/path/to/reference.md)`
