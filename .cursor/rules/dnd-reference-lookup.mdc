# D&D Reference Data Lookup

This project contains extracted D&D 5e (2024) reference data. Use these indexes for efficient lookups.

## Lookup Strategy (Fastest to Slowest)

1. **Grep JSON indexes** - For name-to-path lookups
2. **Read quick-reference files** - For scanning key stats
3. **Read cross-reference files** - For grouped lookups (by CR, rarity, etc.)
4. **Read individual markdown files** - For full details

## Index Files

| File | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `books/reference-index.json` | Name/type/path lookup for all 2,493 entries |
| `books/keyword-index.json` | Semantic lookups (damage types, creature types, schools) |

## Quick Reference Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `books/reference/spells/quick-reference.md` | 393 spells: level, school, time, range |
| `books/reference/creatures/quick-reference.md` | 592 creatures: CR, type, size, HP, AC |
| `books/reference/items/quick-reference.md` | 1,244 items: rarity, type, attunement |
| `books/reference/equipment/quick-reference.md` | 264 equipment: type, cost, damage/AC |

## Cross-Reference Files (`books/cross-references/`)

- `creatures-by-cr.md` - Creatures grouped by Challenge Rating
- `creatures-by-type.md` - Creatures grouped by type (Aberration, Beast, etc.)
- `spells-by-level.md` - Spells grouped by level
- `spells-by-school.md` - Spells grouped by school
- `items-by-rarity.md` - Items grouped by rarity
- `items-by-type.md` - Items grouped by type

## Example Lookups

Find a spell by name:

```bash
grep -i "fireball" books/reference-index.json
```

Find all fire-related content:

```bash
grep -A 5 '"fire":' books/keyword-index.json
```

Find CR 5 creatures: Read `books/cross-references/creatures-by-cr.md` section "## CR 5"
